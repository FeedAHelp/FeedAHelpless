# Turborepo starter

Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It is designed to be incrementally adopted, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

Turborepo leverages advanced build system techniques to speed up development, both on your local machine and your CI/CD. It does this by:

- Using caching to avoid re-running tasks that have already been run.
- Optimizing task pipelines to run as efficiently as possible.
- Providing a unified interface for running tasks, regardless of the underlying build tool.
- Turborepo can be used to build a wide variety of JavaScript and TypeScript projects, including:

- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Serverless functions
- Progressive web apps (PWAs)
- Command-line tools
- To use Turborepo, you first need to install it. You can do this with the following command:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
